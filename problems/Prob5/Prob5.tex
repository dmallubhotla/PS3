\section{1-D Ising Model Long-Range interactions}

For this problem, we want to evaluate the Peierls argument for long-range interactions modelled by the Hamiltonian:
\begin{equation}
	\ham = -J \sum_{i\neq j}^N \frac{s_i s_j }{\abs{i-j}^a}
\end{equation}
In addition, we're given that $s \in \{-1, 1\}$, and $a > 0$. We want to show that the Peierls argument fails for $a < 2$, meaning that with $a$ in that range, there is indeed a phase transition. 

Like with the original argument, we can find the free energy $A$ for $m = 0$ and $m = 1$. We note that the entropies are unchanged: 
\begin{align}
	S_{m = 0} &< \kb \log \frac{N}{2} \\
	S_{m = 1} &= 0
\end{align}
We need to find the energies. For $m = 1$:
\begin{align}
	U &=  \sum_{i\neq j}^N \frac{s_i s_j }{\abs{i-j}^a} \\
	&= \sum_{i\neq j}^N \frac{1}{\abs{i-j}^a} \\
\end{align}
